This folder contains test vectors for Noise that were copied from other
projects. The file format is the JSON one described [on the Noise
wiki](https://github.com/noiseprotocol/noise_wiki/wiki/Test-vectors)
for most of these.

- `cacophony.txt` comes from
  <https://github.com/haskell-cryptography/cacophony/blob/e550baf233d044d46fc2b141d21df4478a63425f/vectors/cacophony.txt>.
- `flynn.txt` comes from
  <https://github.com/flynn/noise/blob/d803f5c4b0f4c9bb4d8234603b9cf6c194f6b135/vectors.txt>.
  It uses a text-based file format.
